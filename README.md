# MalariaParasiteinMosquito
Companion scripts for Live imaging combined with high throughput image analysis reveals the kinetics of malaria parasite invasion in the midgut of Anopheles vector mosquitoes

Data (images and extracted data as text files) are hosted on cid.curie.fr, Project "Malaria paraiste invasion in the mosquito tissues"

The database is managed using OpenImadis https://strandls.github.io/openimadis/

The api documentation is available here, under API tab:
https://cid.curie.fr/iManage/api/client/

The api client jar is available here:

Segmentation of paraistes, nuclei and quantification of intenisties corrected by background are performed using a set of ImageJ Plugins in Java, Parasite_Malaria_Study

Analysis of the position of parasites relative to cell layer and statistics are performed with Matlab.
